# read_mapping_figure
Python and Processing (python mode) scripts to map reads on a circular contig

Basically you run the python script with a sam file and a list of contigs you're interested in, and take the output of that and run it through the processing script. The result is a nice figure with circular contigs showing where their reads map to.
